Create LimitRange Resource

Step1: download the "demo_file.yml"
       rename the file as per your understanding
       
Step2: Open the file and edit it as your requirment 
       like how much cpu or memory or storage you want to set limit for
       just change the no. inside the file
       or you can remove some "- types"
       
Step3: create a limitrange resource, same way we create other resource 
       
[ ]# oc create --save-config -f demo_file.yml
[ ]# oc get limitrange
      
Thas all... 
You created a limitrange resource

if you notice we haven,t pass any project name inside the demo_file.yml
it's because we create limitrange inside a project
so the limit-range are set for the current project/namespace that you are in.
